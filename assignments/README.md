Root folder for all the assignments in this course.

The file name indicate the assignment number 1, 2, 3..., and the **accomplishment** section in each file is my actual work.

Please prefer the PDF format since it is well formated. If you want to check the markdown file instead, I recommend  you to use [Typora](https://typora.io) because the markdown syntax in GitHub is slight different.
